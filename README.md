<h1> Interactive map to visualize the distribution of speed from the SF Bay Area via Mapbox </h1>
<ul>
        <li> Visualizes over half a million traffic data points from the SF Bay Area via Mapbox </li>
         <li> Points are colored according to the speed recorded by the Comma.ai dash cam app Chffr  </li>
         <li> Design inspired by Google Traffic Heat Maps  </li>
         </ul>

<h4> Because there were over 200 Mb of data, it was impossible to render them dynamically using GeoJSON.
Hence, the GeoJSON file is compiled into VectorTiles to have design flexibility </h2>
